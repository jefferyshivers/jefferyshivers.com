      </h2>
      <p>
        Hi, I'm Jeffery Shivers. I am currently a Software Engineer at <a href="https://pos.toasttab.com"
          target="_blank">Toast</a> in Boston.
      </p>

      <p>
        I usually work in Java (Dropwizard, Protocol Buffers / gRPC, Pulsar) and NodeJS (React, Express).
      </p>
      <p>
        Sometimes I work on open source projects like GNU LilyPond (Google Summer of Code 2016) and the Open Music
        Initiative (IDEO
        Cambridge, Summer 2017 fellowship). I also occasionally put pet projects up on
        <a href="https://github.com/jefferyshivers" target="_blank">Github</a> and post articles on
        <a href="https://medium.com/@jefferyshivers" target="_blank">Medium</a>. I am currently working on a package
        manager for Protocol Buffers called "Salsa", modeled after NPM.
      </p>
      <p>
        Prior to beginning my career in software development, I studied music composition, and have had performances of
        my music
        around the
        U.S. and Europe. I've held several artist residencies, including one at Listhus in northern Iceland, and I've
        lectured
        on my music at Harvard University and Fabra i Coats in Barcelona.

        <h3><a href="https://github.com/tacolabs/paper"><em>latex-js</em>. a Node library for creating TeX documents
            from
            Javascript</a></h3>
        <p>
          This library allows you to programatically create LaTeX source documents from Javascript. This would be useful
          in cases where rigid components of a document structure are not known until runtime, such as the presence or
          appearance of a section, or perhaps how the compiler should handle the variable document.

        <h3><a href="https://github.com/tacolabs/paper"><em>Paper</em>. a Java library that provides an interface around
            documents that can be rendered</a></h3>
        <p>
          This is a pet project of mine which focuses on defining a simply API around a document representation and the
          way it is interacted with and rendered into something else.
          The project comes with a small plugin module that includes example implmentations for HTML documents and a
          Flying Saucer PDF renderer.

        <p>
          I worked on ScholarLY, a part of the OpenLilyLib project,
          in summer 2016 as a Google Summer of Code intern following the completion of my
          grad studies
          at Tufts.

      <p>I earned a B.M. in composition (Lamar University, 2014) and an M.A. in music composition (Tufts University,
        2016). Throughout (and briefly after) my studies, I held several artist residencies around the United States and
        Europe. A couple years ago, I decided to focus more on my career as a software engineer; the premiere of <a
          href="https://soundcloud.com/jefferyshivers/minimum-enclosure">minimum enclosure</a> at
        the 2017 Harvard Summer Music Institute was my last formal musical venture, at least in academia. I still
        make music, but for the most part keep it pretty casual nowadays.
      </p>

      <p>
        Here's some of my music from over the years.
